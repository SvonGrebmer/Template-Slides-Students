## Questions from previous submodule

- **Aim**:  This first slide is dedicated to clarifying questions from the previous submodule and/or to discuss assignments. 
- Additional slides may need to be added depending on the nature of the homework assignments. 
- Critical for the learning process to ensure that students are on the same page and have been able to achieve the learning goals of the previous workshop. 
- Not applicable if this set of slides corresponds to the first submodule of a new module. 

---

## Before we start: Survey time!

- **Aim**: The pre-submodule survey serves to examine students' prior knowledge about the sumodule's topic.
- Use free survey software such as  or other survey software (particify, formR) to establish the following questions (shown on separate slides):

---

**What is your level of familiarity with [Topic] (e.g., basic concepts, terminology, or tools)?**

a. I have never heard of it before.

b. I have heard of it but have never worked with it.

c. I have basic understanding and experience with it.

d. I am very familiar and have worked with it extensively.

---

**Which of the following concepts or skills do you feel most confident about in relation to [Topic]? (Select all that apply)**

a. Concept 1

b. Concept 2

c. Concept 3

d. Concept 4

e. I am not sure about any of these concepts.

---

**On a scale of 1 to 5, how comfortable are you with using [specific tool/technology] related to [Topic]?
(1 = Not comfortable at all, 5 = Very comfortable)**

a. 1

b. 2

c. 3

d. 4

e. 5

## Discussion of survey results

- **Aim"**: Briefly examine the answers given to each question interactively with the group.
- Use visuals from the survey to highlight specific answers.

::: {.notes}
Make it clear to the group that there will be a similar post-submodule survey to examine understanding and learning progress.
:::

---

## Where are we at?

- **Aim**: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context.
- Remind students what you are working towards and what the biggeer picture is.

---

## Learning goals

- **Aim**: Formulate specific, action-oriented goals learning goals which are measurable and observable in line with Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001; Bloom et al., 1956)

- Place an emphasis on the **verbs** of the learning goals and choose verbs that align with the skills you want to develop or assess.
- Examples: 
  - Students will **describe** the process of photosynthesis or
  - Students will **construct** a diagram illustrating the process of photosynthesis

---

## Key terms and definitions

- **Aim**: Introduce key terms and definitions that students will come across throughout the session.
<br>

- **Key Term 1**: Definition
- **Key Term 2**: Definition
- **Key Term 3**: Definition

::: {.notes}
Base yourself on conceptual change theory and examine exisiting concepts in relation to some key terms. Re-examine formation of new concepts at the end of the lesson. 
:::

---

## Introduction of submodule topic

- **Aim**: Core theoretical introduction of submodule topic.
- Pair theoretical aspects with practical exercises and group discussions according to the Think-Pair-Share style and according to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1980).
- Use multiple slides for this part.

::: {.notes}
For a 90-minute lesson, the instructor should try to "lecture" for only 20 minutes, students should work in groups/pairs/on their own for at least 55 minutes of the lesson (+ a 15 minute break).
:::
---

## Submodule content slide

- **Aim**: Present relevant content
- Highlight particularly important aspects with Quarto call-out boxes, for example: 

::: {.callout-important}
## Important with Title

This is an example of a callout box to highlight particularly important information.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout box to give important tips. 
:::

---

## Pre-break survey

- **Aim**: This pre-break survey serves to examine students' current understanding of key concepts of the submodule
- Use free survey software such as  or other survey software (particify, formR) to establish the following questions (shown on separate slides):
---

**Which species is the largest type of penguin**?

a. Chinstrap Penguin

b. Emperor Penguin ✅

c. Adélie Penguin

d. King Penguin

---

**What is the key biological feature that helps penguins swim efficiently?**

a. Hollow bones for buoyancy

b. Webbed feet for paddling

c. Waterproof feathers and flipper-like wings ✅

d. Gills to breathe underwater

---

# Break! 15 minutes

---

## Post-break survey discussion

- **Aim**: To clarify concepts and aspects that are not yet understood
- Highlight specific answers given during the survey

---

## Practical exercises on topic

- **Aim**: Design practical exercises for students to apply the new skills in practise.
- Depending on the topic, the exercises should be in accordance with the learning objective(s).

::: {.notes}
For students who advance faster: Prepare extra exercises. 
:::

---

## Relevance and implications

- **Aim**: To work out the relevance of the topic to your students.
- In an interactive setting, discuss how the new skills could be applied in practise with specific examples.
- Examine downfalls and practical obstacles.

---

## Take-home message

**Aim**: End lesson on clear take-home message that are interactively compiled by students.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Title

Add one practical tips or take-home message.
:::

---

## Assignment

- **Aim**: Explain the homework assignment and the rationale behind the homework.
- Examine whether/how it will be assessed
- Mention scoring rubrics, if applicable
- Design a peer-review system for assignments to place students in role of reviewer and author
